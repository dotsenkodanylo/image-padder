#Image Padder
'Image-Padder' is a custom NodeJS script, that allows for quick and snappy image editing. The project goal is to offer
a generously dynamic but feature-conservative script for personal image editing, with two main editing stages; 
* Images will be edited by applying a black border, and a marginal increase to the image width past the border. 
* Secondary edit will apply a square boxing around the given image(s).
